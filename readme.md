A discord bot to provide weather updates and forecasts to your server!

Server participants can call the bot based off a city name or a given (US) zipcode. The bot is familiar with these 2 following commands:
 - $weather 
 - $forecast

Both commands accept either city or zip. For example, if I was interested in the current temperature in Austin, I could call the bot as follows:
- $weather Austin

and the bot would return with:
- It is currently 86 degrees in Austin!

If I was interested in looking up the weather forecast for a given zipcode, I could once again call the bot as follows:
- $forecast 90210

and the bottom would return like this:

Date   | Temp (F) |  Weather

2021-06-09 |   73   | Rain

2021-06-10 |   70   | Rain

2021-06-11 |   67   | Clouds

2021-06-12 |   72   | Clouds

2021-06-13 |   70   | Clear

2021-06-14 |   72   | Clear

**Enjoy!**
